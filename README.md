# Note-Taker
### Note Taker Application, Specifically building and connecting the back end to the front end using Express.JS. 
#### In this project I was tasked with developing the back-end of the Note-Taker Application and deploying it to Heroku. By using knowledge of Express.JS, I was able to attach back-end to front end to allow for the application to function properly.
